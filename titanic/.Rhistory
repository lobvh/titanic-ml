#If we have John Bradely in test_set it's breaking the rule we mentioned earlier.
#There might be the cases where duplicate data in training_data is good for example if there are repeated medical tests.
#But I will deal with that some other times. For this time being I will say it is not good if we encounter them.
####

#Unique will return array of names that are unique by excluding duplicates, so if the length of such array is smaller
#than number_of_observations in data_combined we potentially have duplicates.
#####
length(unique(as.character(data_combined$name)))
#####
#1307<1309 So we can have a situation that those 2 names resemble one of the names (so we have three same names)
#or each one of them is unique and thus we have duplicates. Remember, we are telling the R that we are finding uniqe rows
#and that measure of the 'uniqueness' is name feature!
#####
####
#Let's find those 2 names and see what kind of situation they resemble (3 "same" names or two duplicates)
#Here, only duplicated needs to be discussed, everything else we've seen before.
#duplicated() searches for duplicate names an returns TRUE on those that have higher subscripts
#For example if we have duplicate name at 5th row and the same name at 16th row it will return TRUE on 16th row.
####
duplicate_names <- as.character(data_combined[which(duplicated(as.character(data_combined$name))), "name"])
####
#Now we see that those names are actually duplicates. Using duplicated_names we will take a look at those records with each feature.
####
data_combined[which(data_combined$name %in% duplicate_names),]
####
#First of all we will explain how %in% works "make a logical vector such that for each name in data_combined return TRUE
#if that name is in duplicate_names".
#
#From data analysis perspective we can conclude that overall, those names or should we say "data points" as a whore are not
#duplicates. There are a lot of fun scenarios that could happen in pclass=3 and those people meeting each other out.
#At the end it would be fun to see are those with the same name in the test_set survived or not.
#Maybe that's one of the Kaggle's eastereggs?
#Thing that is a littlleee fishy to me is that both Connolly, Miss. Kate have similar tickets and it might be
#interesting or not if that means that they were close and met each other.
#It might be an endevour to deduce fare size using other variables and I think that Connolly, Miss. Kate might
#help us with that "good time".
#####
####
#Now that we are "sure" (hopefully!) that we ain't have duplicate names we can proceed.
#Since "title" might be nice feature to engineer let's see if it has any correlation with other features.
#If one of the features has too much missing values, we can use new features as proxies and thus save some time with the imputation.
#It is one of the strategies for handling missing data.
#
#So, let's see if there are any correlations with other variables to see if we are on a good track to extract title as feature.
####
#We gonna import R's stringr library which is helpful for string manipulations
library(stringr)
#Let's look at the misses:
misses <- data_combined[which(str_detect(data_combined$name, "Miss.")),]
misses[1:5,]
####
#str_detect(string, pattern_in_string) returns a logical vector showing if pattern occured in the string
#which function is "smart enought" to convert those logical table to particular numbers of rows where those occured
####
####
#From this sample few things strike my interest, but when deciding if there are any correlations between that and title
#some of them might be used in aggregate, and some not:
# 1) All of the misses from this sample survived and they are in the third class. Might potentially help us
#    to understand who actually survived in third class. There aren't many, but not all people is dead!
# 2) There is a bit of a variance in age but in an essence we can conclude they are relatively young.
#  At this stage we can give a hypothesis that title correlates with age.
# Since they are "unmarried" sibsp>0 would indicate that either they are traveling with siblings or not.
# If they are widows (some prefer to be called Miss!) we would never know, but in general we can conclude they are
# unmarried women.
# parch>0 would indicate that either they are traveling with parents or childrens (if they are widows)
# or parent(s) and child(ren)
# It is not biologically possible that Sandstrom, Miss. Marguerite Rut could have a children thus I conclude that
# parch for her means she is traveling with parent.
summary(misses$age)
# The mean of 'miss' population is around 21.77 and 75% of misses are 30 years or less, so relatively "young population".
# Remember also that we are making judgement with 50 NA's!
# We can also give an assumption that those are non-married woman (that is what metadata is saying!) but they might
# They might travel with their (boy)friend(s) but we can investigate them only by looking at ticket's etc.
# That might be helpfull for model to give better predictions.
#####
#Let's look at the mrs-es:
mrses <- data_combined[which(str_detect(data_combined$name, "Mrs.")), ]
mrses[1:5,]
####
#From this sample we can conclude that they have high survival rate, and that they are more distributed toward upper classes
#2 of them are in first class, and another two at second class. 4/5 are in upper classes.
#They are relatively "old" in ages, but they are either widows or married (that is also what name feature is confirming!)
summary(mrses$age)
#Their mean is relatively higher than that in misses (36.8), and 75% of them are bellow 46.5 so relatively old!
#Another confirmation that the age might be correlated with title IN GENERAL!
#Nasser, Mrs. Nicholas (Adele Achem) raises an eyebrow but understanding how "eastern people" work (and name sounds quite "easterish")
#nothing surprises me at that age. Maybe she is too young to be married because of data collection being wrong (and indeed it does!)
#Maybe in practise her age is >insert_age_where_you_can_give_birth but this is the "real" data we are concernig with.
#We get what we measure. Thus assumptions are based on data we are provided.
####
#Since there are many more unique titles, we will be concerned with those that make huge % of data.
#We've done with the females, so next logical step would be to see what's interesting about males!
####
males <- data_combined[which(data_combined$sex == "male"),]
males[1:5,]
#### FACTS
# From this sample we can conclude that 5/5 are dead, 4/5*100% are in the third class
# Mr can be either married or nonmarried man. Nothing about that can be deduced from their age if they are or if they are not,
# but Master is proxy for younger boy. Those are definetly nonmarried males (or we hope so!) IN GENERAL.
# So, sibsp>1 (aswell as sibsp=0!) could be indicative of Mr. travelling with their spouses IN GENERAL!
# My gosh there is so much variability to handle and think of...
# About titles and fares correlation, I think we need to use other features to conclude fare not just title.
# Maybe there are patterns that would help us on overall score, but that is digging tooo much into the rabbit hole!
####
####
#Since these are all the facts that concern only small subset of population (aka sample) we will expand it to see
#if we can find some insights. We are gonna extract title feature by creating utility function for doing so, and then

#That higher class people had more chance of survival is confirmed this time.

#
#If one excludes everything except one title and see if there is any pattern, one would see that

#
#For example,if you just focus on Mr. title for three classes you will see that relative survival rate (based on the percent!)
#declines as we progress from first to third class. That same logic applies for each title.
#
#Title "Others" seem to be just in first two classes so might be indicative of folks (titles) who are rich.
#
#Mr.'s in second and third class have relative survival rate almost the same (around 1/8), those in first class have better survival rate!
#This is the thing with analysis: Even if Mr.'s in third class had lower rate of survival we should explain why, and see
#those who survived, can we see using other features (but be careful not to overfit!) to find a trend for survival of folks in third class.
#Fact (and hypothesis!?): Title would be a really good predictor of survival.

summary(data_combined$age)
###
#From the whole data_combined dataset (training+set) we see that there are a lot of NA's (around 20%!) and that is a lot of

# For the ages one can for example impute missing ages with the (title etc.) mean or (title etc.) median.
# Or make a linear regression model using every other feature except age as an independent variable and age as dependent,
# make prediction's for the missing age and impute NA's with their predicted values, but keeping non-NA's as same.
# I've seen some authors say that if one put 0 as all NA's than for example neural network eventually learn that those are missing data.
# Probably each ones have different drawbacks.
#
# What we are gonna do here is run some "tests" to confirm that title could be a good proxy for age, so we are gonna forget about imputing missing values if we
# confirm that for each title it's age distribution relatively generalizes that title.
# And hopefully if we have "check" on each title, we are "safe" to ignore age and thus the imputation of it's missing values.
###
####
#Some conclusions that stick to my head using the summary on age on whole dataset is that people here are relatively young (one can define young however he choses!) .
# 75% of them are 40 and younger, and that 50% is less than 28.
# There are some outliers which could be justified or not based on other features.
# Mean is sliiiiiightly bigger than median which indicates sliiiiiiight skewnes to the right and thus sligghttt tendency
# toward the "bigger age".
